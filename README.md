# turtle-crossing-start
# Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the Up keypress to move the turtle north. 
# Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen (think of it as a safe zone for our little turtle). Hint: generate a new car only every 6th time the game loop runs
# Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens
# Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y). When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars. Hint: think about creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed
